# Insurance and lending company using Python

## Risk Analysis & Predictive Modeling Project
This project explores how financial and insurance companies assess customer risk using synthetic data that mimics real-world behavior. I worked with three large, interconnected datasets (20,000+ records each) to uncover patterns, clean inconsistencies, and build insights that support smarter decision-making.
# Python â€“ Data Engineering & Exploration

- ðŸ§¹ Fixing messy values like negative incomes and invalid credit scores
- ðŸ§  Creating new features such as risk_category (based on credit behavior) and debt_to_income_ratio (to assess financial stress)
- ðŸ”— Merging datasets and validating data integrity across customer, loan, and insurance records
- ðŸ“Š Exploring trends and distributions using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to uncover early risk signals
