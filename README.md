## Risk Analysis & Predictive Modeling Project
This project explores how financial and insurance companies assess customer risk using synthetic data that mimics real-world behavior. I worked with three large, interconnected datasets (20,000+ records each) to uncover patterns, clean inconsistencies, and build insights that support smarter decision-making.
# Python â€“ Data Engineering & Exploration

I used Python to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This included:
â€¢ 	ðŸ§¹ Fixing messy values like negative incomes and invalid credit scores
â€¢ 	ðŸ§  Creating new features such as  and 
â€¢ 	ðŸ”— Merging datasets and validating data integrity
